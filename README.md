# About me

💻 I’m currently learning on **data analysis, visualization and ML**

- 📈 I’m here to share my upcoming projects on all essential tools needed to become a good data analyst and to build a solid portfolio.

- 👨‍🎓 I completed DUT first year in *Networks and Telecommunications* at `Nice Sophia Antipolis`, then followed my studies remotely through CTES (Centre de Télé-enseignement à distance). I later earned a bachelor’s degree (licence double) in mathematics with a focus on computer science from `Aix‑Marseille University`, followed by a Master’s 1 in *general computer science and applications* from `Marie and Louis Pasteur University` (UFR Sciences et Techniques)

- 🚀 Being curious, my goal is to explore **SQL**, **Power BI**, **Python**, **R** and many other tools as I continue learning and improving myself.
